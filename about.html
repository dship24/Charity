    <p class="about">
      <em>Pokemovement</em> is a global non-profit organization saving and
      restoring pokemon from the cruelties of this world.
    </p>
    <p class="about2">
      We help pokemon all around the world by rescuing them from abusive
      trainers and nursing them in local pokecenters. We make sure that each and
      every pokemon is back to it's full strength before finding a new trainer.
    </p>
    <p class="about">
      At our pokecenters, our licensed practitioners check the pokemon for any
      injuries on the surface - cuts, bruises, wounds, etc. Then they search the
      body for broken limbs or bones, so they can begin that healing process
      quickly. The nurses also rehabilitate any internal bleeding or fractures,
      for those are the most detrimental of injuries.
    </p>
    <p class="about2">
      Through time and goodwill, we restore the pokemon so they can live full
      lives with trainers that will fight for the pokemon as much as the pokemon
      will for them.
    </p>
    <p class="about">
      To support our cause and to aid these poor pokemon on their journeys,
      <strong>you</strong> can help by donating to <em>Pokemovement</em>.
      Together we can rid the world of abusive pokemon trainers and bring peace
      and harmony to all pokemon.
